description: My interest for visual thinking has grown over the years.

I have discovered **visual thinking**, in 2016 and my interest for it has never stopped to grow ever since. I have had the opportunity to see people use it in meetings and it always seemed to be success as it allows people to participate and open up more. Nowadays, I try to use it any time I can to explain my ideas.
