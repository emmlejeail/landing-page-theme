_09-2015 -> Today_

Since September 2015, I am part of the organization team of a **music festival**. This is an association very close to my heart as it is a 100% volunteer team. I discovered the festival when beginning my studies at the UTC.
I was first member of the **technical team** for the 2016's edition, and then became the **technical manager** of the 2017's edition. This year I am the **vice-president** in charge of supervising both the technical and booking team's work.
This positions made me grow and gave me **project management** as well as **teamwork** skills.
The previous edition gathered almost 11 000 people and we are now aiming at gathering 12 000 people for the 5th edition of the festival.
The website of the Imaginarium Festival is available [here](https://imaginariumfestival.com).
