I really enjoy traveling to new places, that's partly why I decided to do my first internship in computer science abroad (Amsterdam, NL).
I have a good level of **English** and also speak **Spanish** as well as a bit of **Japanese** (in addition to French which is my native language).
I'm still looking forward to discover Asia and the South Pacific.
