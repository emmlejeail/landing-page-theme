_09-2017 -> 02-2018_

Internship at The Things Industries as a solution engineer. My work revolved around developing **Front-End applications** for use cases using **LoRa** and **LoRaWAN** technologies, as well as developing a **Python SDK** for The Things Network in order to ease developer's connection to TTN while coding in Python.
During this internship I also worked with programming languages such as javascript (**Node.js**) and got familiar with frameworks like Vue.js.
